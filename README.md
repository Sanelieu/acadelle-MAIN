# acadelle-MAIN
Please do not recreate, this is just a main project for someone who has absolutely no idea what they're doing LOL



Some notes? haha: 

ðŸ’›- Working on slash commands, still not quite understanding some things though (a lot of things it seems).

ðŸ’›- Any comments are very helpful, im working on things the way that work for me, regardless of being "easy" or "difficult" in comparison. Main thing is just avoiding errors in the terminal, or things that result in the bot itself breaking - not working as intended

ðŸ’›- bot is opeating on discord.js v12.5 ; great thanks to @mischief1337 (dutboot), who seems to make this a lot easier than i originally had it in v14

ðŸ’›- trying out some "premium" command ideas sooner or later, being global ban (like monty's 'melanie' bot), or tag lookup (jon's 'bleed' bot)
